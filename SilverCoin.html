Each is worth 100x the coin of the previous value. One Platinum Coin is worth one million Copper Coins.</p><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Obtaining_Coins"> Obtaining Coins </span></h2><p>Coins can be acquired by killing <a title="Monster" class="mw-redirect">monsters</a>, breaking <span class="link"><a href="Pot.html" title="Pot">pots</a></span>, or trading with <a title="NPC">NPCs</a> (or other players). Even though the Coins are "Copper", "Silver" or "Gold", it is impossible to craft them from <a title="Ore" class="mw-redirect">Ore</a>, <a title="Bar" class="mw-redirect">Bars</a>, or any other item in general (apart from a different rank of Coins).</p><h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Coin_harvest_techniques"> Coin harvest techniques </span></h3><dl><dd><i>See <a title="Guide:Making Money" class="mw-redirect">Guide:Making Money</a> for more information on acquiring coins.</i></dd></dl><p>An easy way to acquire Coins is to harvest <span class="link"><a href="SandBlock.html" title="Sand Block">Sand Blocks</a></span>, craft the sand into <span class="link"><a href="Glass.html" title="Glass">Glass</a></span> then <span class="link"><a href="Bottle.html" title="Bottle">Bottles</a></span>, and then sell those to an <a title="NPC">NPC</a> for 4 copper per tile of sand. <span class="link"><a href="Ale.html" title="Ale">Ale</a></span> is even more profitable, as it turns 2 sand into 20 copper for an exchange of 10 copper per unit of sand. </p><p>An even better way, however needing a few items such as a <span class="link"><a href="Bucket.html" title="Bucket">Bucket</a></span> and a <span class="link"><a href="NightmarePickaxe.html" title="Nightmare Pickaxe">Nightmare Pickaxe</a></span>, is to use an <span class="link"><a href="Obsidian.html" title="Obsidian">Obsidian</a></span> Generator to mass-produce <span class="link"><a href="ObsidianSkull.html" title="Obsidian Skull">Obsidian Skulls</a></span>. These sell for 54 silver each, so selling two of them already gives you over 1 Gold Coin. With this technique, it is possible to acquire the <span class="link"><a href="Minishark.html" title="Minishark">Minishark</a></span> in half an hour.</p><p>Obtaining Coins through battling <span class="link"><a href="MeteorHead.html" title="Meteor Head">Meteor Heads</a></span> is also an easy option, but it requires 50 <span class="link"><a href="Meteorite.html" title="Meteorite">Meteorite</a></span> and preferably something good to beat <span class="link"><a href="MeteorHead.html" title="Meteor Head">Meteor Heads</a></span> with. (<a title="Guide:Arena">Arenas guide on farming Meteor heads</a>)</p><p>Repeatedly killing the <span class="link"><a href="EyeofCthulhu.html" title="Eye of Cthulhu">Eye of Cthulhu</a></span> can farm an average of about 50 <span class="link"><a href="DemoniteOre.html" title="Demonite Ore">Demonite Ore</a></span> which sells for 8 silver each, which adds to 4 gold a run.</p><p>In <a title="Hardmode">hardmode</a>, travelling to the <a title="Underground Hallow">Underground Hallow</a> and collecting as many <span class="link"><a href="CrystalShard.html" title="Crystal Shard">Crystal Shards</a></span> as possible is an extremely efficient way to acquire large amounts of money, as one full stack (consisting of 250 shards) sells for 40 gold coins (16 silver coins per shard), plus it doesn't require any specific early investment or preparation (other than reaching hard mode itself). Crystals are abundant, easy to locate and mine, and respawn. Killing enemies that appear as you run around the Underground Hallow will let you collect even more coins.</p><p>Another one requiers some preperation. An obsidian generator and a <span class="link"><a href="Bucket.html" title="Bucket">Bucket</a></span> are needed as well as a load of <span class="link"><a href="ObsidianSkinPotion.html" title="Obsidian Skin Potion">Obsidian Skin Potion</a></span>.</p><p>Step 1: Get loads of obsidian from your generator using the bucket.</p><p>Step 2: Drink a <span class="link"><a href="ObsidianSkinPotion.html" title="Obsidian Skin Potion">Obsidian Skin Potion</a></span> and mine loads of <span class="link"><a href="Hellstone.html" title="Hellstone">Hellstone</a></span>.</p><p>Step 3: Make loads of <span class="link"><a href="HellstoneBar.html" title="Hellstone Bar">Hellstone Bar</a></span>. DO NOT MAKE THEM INTO EQUIPMENT!</p><p>Step 4: Sell. A 25 stack sells for about 12 gold 45 silver whereas a molten helmet (see <a title="Molten armor">Molten armor</a>) that requires 25 bars sells for only 90 silver.</p><p>Another one exploits a bug. If you try to place a <span class="link"><a href="MusicBox.html" title="Music Box">Music Box</a></span> that has already recorded a song on a Table or Platform in Single Player (but not Multiplayer), it will duplicate itself repeatedly, spamming the ground. You can sell the <span class="link"><a href="MusicBox.html" title="Music Box">Music Boxes</a></span> for VERY fast money farming. Be warned, however, that generating too many Music Boxes will cause other dropped items on the ground to despawn.</p><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Storage"> Storage </span></h2><p>Like other items, Coins can be stored in <span class="link"><a href="Chest.html" title="Chest">Chests</a></span> and <span class="link"><a href="PiggyBank.html" title="Piggy Bank">Piggy Banks</a></span>. It is recommended to always store them, as it will prevent them from being dropped upon <a title="Death">death</a>, the penalty of which is dropping half of your <i>carried</i> coins (rounded up).</p><p>Inside the <a title="Inventory">Inventory</a>, Coins have their own special set of 4 slots on the right of the inventory grid.</p><p>If for some reason, you cannot store your coins, and are carrying a single high value coin (a Gold Coin early, or a Platinum Coin later), then it might be a smart move to "break" the coin: If you were to die, you would lose only half of the low currency Coins, as opposed to the entire high currency coin. It is also possible to put the coins at your cursor so you can keep them when you die.</p><p>The maximum coins a player can have with only using the coin slots is ten, (1x100x100x100) to make the platinum coin and then times that by another 100 to make 10,000,000 (Ten million). Now multiply that by 4 to get your maximum coinslots. This makes forty million coins total. If the player were to clean out all his inventory and replace them each by 100 platinum coins then the total would be 1x100x100x100x100x40 = Fourhundred million, or 400,000,000. Add these together and the total would be 440,000,000, or 4.4*10^8.</p><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Crafting"> Crafting </span></h2><p>Coins can be crafted <a title="By hand" class="mw-redirect">by hand</a>. Each coin is worth 100 of the sub denomination. A point of interest to note is that when the player picks up an item, the coins are <i>automatically</i> crafted if possible. This means that if the player picks up hundreds of Silver Coins, he'll end up with a few Gold Coins in his inventory, and less than 100 Silver Coins.This means that you can craft coins a lot easier (especially if you are up against a wall) by simply throwing a stack of coins out of your inventory. When you pick them up, they will be crafted for you. So if you threw 100 silver coins out of your inventory, you would pick up 1 gold instead.</p><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Notes"> Notes </span></h2><ul><li>Uncollected coins sparkle when in the vicinity of a light source, and will actually amplify its light. The effect stacks the more coins are present in a grouping.</li><li>Although it is a useless feature, Coins can be sold to <a title="NPC">NPCs</a> like the <span class="link"><a href="Merchant.html" title="Merchant">Merchant</a></span> for their value. That is, if you sell a silver coin, you get 1 silver coin in return.</li></ul><div style="margin: 1em; border: solid silver; border-width: 1px 0px; padding: 2px 1em 2px .2em; clear:left"><div class="floatleft"><a title="Bug"><img alt="Bug.png" width="18" height="24" name="img/Bug.png"></a></div> <strong class="hiddenlinks" style="color: #900;"><a title="Bug">Bug</a>:</strong> If you have no existing Gold Coins and you attempt the sell enough items to NPC vendors requiring them to be created, they will not be created if your coins only occupy the bottom-most Coin slots in your inventory with no spaces. The game attempts to push down your other coins to create the first Gold Coin, and if it has no room to do that, it will increase your Silver coins until 100 then start again from zero, without giving you any Gold Coins, netting you a loss that can be significant. After suffering from this bug. Log out and in, and your gold will reappear (this is still untested in singleplayer)</div><div style="margin: 1em; border: solid silver; border-width: 1px 0px; padding: 2px 1em 2px .2em; clear:left"><div class="floatleft"><a title="Bug"><img alt="Bug.png" width="18" height="24" name="img/Bug.png"></a></div> <strong class="hiddenlinks" style="color: #900;"><a title="Bug">Bug</a>:</strong> If you use the quick-sell method to an NPC, then the money you got becomes part of what you sell, and you get nothing in return.</div><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="History"> History </span></h2><ul><li><b><a title="1.0.6" class="mw-redirect">1.0.6</a></b>: Sparkle and light amplification added.</li><li><b><a title="Pre-Release" class="mw-redirect">Pre-Release</a></b>: Introduced.</li></ul><!-- NewPP limit reportPreprocessor node count: 250/1000000Post-expand include size: 2593/2097152 bytesTemplate argument size: 1085/2097152 bytesExpensive parser function count: 0/100--><!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_terrariaonline:pcache:idhash:766-1!*!0!!en!2 and timestamp 20111215202819 --></div>
