Each is worth 100x the coin of the previous value. One Platinum Coin is worth one million Copper Coins.</p><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Obtaining_Coins"> Obtaining Coins </span></h2><p>Coins can be acquired by killing <a title="Monster" class="mw-redirect">monsters</a>, breaking <span class="link"><a href="Pot.html" title="Pot">pots</a></span>, or trading with <a title="NPC">NPCs</a> (or other players). Even though the Coins are "Copper", "Silver" or "Gold", it is impossible to craft them from Ore, Bars, or any other item in general (apart from a different rank of Coins)</p><h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Coin_harvest_techniques"> Coin harvest techniques </span></h3><dl><dd><i>See <a title="Guide:Making Money" class="mw-redirect">Guide:Making Money</a> for more information on acquiring coins.</i></dd></dl><p>An easy way to acquire Coins is to harvest <span class="link"><a href="SandBlock.html" title="Sand Block">Sand Blocks</a></span>, craft the sand into <span class="link"><a href="Glass.html" title="Glass">Glass</a></span> then <span class="link"><a href="Bottle.html" title="Bottle">Bottles</a></span>, and then sell those to an <a title="NPC">NPC</a> for 4 copper per tile of sand. Crafting <span class="link"><a href="Ale.html" title="Ale">Ale</a></span> via <span class="link"><a href="Mug.html" title="Mug">Mugs</a></span> and a <span class="link"><a href="Keg.html" title="Keg">Keg</a></span> is even more profitable, as it turns 2 sand into 20 copper for an exchange of 10 copper per unit of sand (or 25 silver per full stack).</p><p>If you have advanced through the game to the point of acquiring a <span class="link"><a href="Bucket.html" title="Bucket">Bucket</a></span> and <span class="link"><a href="NightmarePickaxe.html" title="Nightmare Pickaxe">Nightmare Pickaxe</a></span>, you can create an <span class="link"><a href="Obsidian.html" title="Obsidian">Obsidian</a></span> Generator to mass-produce <span class="link"><a href="ObsidianSkull.html" title="Obsidian Skull">Obsidian Skulls</a></span>.  These sell for 54 silver each, so selling just two of them gives you over 1 Gold Coin.  With this technique, it is possible to acquire the <span class="link"><a href="Minishark.html" title="Minishark">Minishark</a></span>, with a price of 35 gold, in half an hour.</p><p>Obtaining Coins by battling <span class="link"><a href="MeteorHead.html" title="Meteor Head">Meteor Heads</a></span> is also an easy option, given their constant spawn rate, but it requires 50 <span class="link"><a href="Meteorite.html" title="Meteorite">Meteorite</a></span> and preferably something good to kill <span class="link"><a href="MeteorHead.html" title="Meteor Head">Meteor Heads</a></span> with. (<a title="Guide:Arena">Arenas guide on farming Meteor heads</a>)</p><p>You can also farm the <span class="link"><a href="EyeofCthulhu.html" title="Eye of Cthulhu">Eye of Cthulhu</a></span> for <span class="link"><a href="DemoniteOre.html" title="Demonite Ore">Demonite Ore</a></span> if you have good enough weapons and armor.  A single Eye will yield an average of about 50 Demonite Ore each time, selling for 8 silver each (about 4 gold in total).  You can also farm the <span class="link"><a href="EaterofWorlds.html" title="Eater of Worlds">Eater of Worlds</a></span>, which will net about 10 gold if everything is collected (although it is arguably more difficult to obtain the materials needed to summon it).</p><p>In <a title="Hardmode">hardmode</a>, travelling to the <a title="Underground Hallow">Underground Hallow</a> and collecting as many <span class="link"><a href="CrystalShard.html" title="Crystal Shard">Crystal Shards</a></span> as possible is an extremely efficient way to acquire large amounts of money, as one full stack (consisting of 250 shards) sells for 40 gold coins (16 silver coins per shard), plus it doesn't require any specific early investment or preparation (other than reaching <a title="Hardmode">hardmode</a> itself). Crystals are abundant, easy to locate and mine, and respawn. Killing enemies that appear as you run around the Underground Hallow will let you collect even more coins.</p><p>A well-paying but somewhat elaborate technique is to use an obsidian generator, Bucket, several <span class="link"><a href="ObsidianSkinPotion.html" title="Obsidian Skin Potion">Obsidian Skin Potions</a></span>, and a <span class="link"><a href="Hellforge.html" title="Hellforge">Hellforge</a></span>:1.  Get plenty of obsidian from the generator.2.  Drink the potions and mine plenty <span class="link"><a href="Hellstone.html" title="Hellstone">Hellstone</a></span>.3.  Combine both obsidian and Hellstone to make <span class="link"><a href="HellstoneBar.html" title="Hellstone Bar">Hellstone Bars</a></span> and sell AS IS - do not try to craft it into armor.  A stack of 25 sells for about 12 gold 45 silver.</p><p>By far the easiest way is to make a chest generator by placing a chest on active stone blocks, placing at least one item in the chest and switching it to inactive. When switched to inactive it will spawn four chests. Chests can then be harvested by either hooking up a switch to the blocks and repeatedly switching the blocks from active to inactive, or if in single player mode, by attempting to place another chest on a single block next to the chest on the inactive blocks. A full stack of gold or shadow chests nets 9 gold and 90 silver. Filling your inventory takes only a few seconds and when sold yields a profit of a few platinum.</p><p>Another quite EASY way is to make another world (It doesn't matter what the name is.),Go to the <a title="Corruption" class="mw-redirect">corruption</a>, Go in one of the deep pits, And then use a <a title="Hammer" class="mw-redirect">Hammer</a> to mine the <a title="Shadow Orbs" class="mw-redirect">Shadow Orbs</a> (You can also sell the items and <span class="link"><a href="Meteorite.html" title="Meteorite">meteorite</a></span> you get from them) Once you have mined 3 <a title="Shadow Orbs" class="mw-redirect">Shadow Orbs</a> the <a title="Eater Of Worlds" class="mw-redirect">Eater Of Worlds</a> will spawn, Kill him and collect everything (I do not collect the <span class="link"><a href="ShadowScale.html" title="Shadow Scale">Shadow Scales</a></span>) Turn the <span class="link"><a href="DemoniteOre.html" title="Demonite Ore">Demonite Ore</a></span> into bars, Then sell them, One stack of 99 <span class="link"><a href="DemoniteBar.html" title="Demonite Bar">Demonite Bars</a></span> Turns into 31 <a title="Gold">Gold</a> <strong class="selflink">coins</strong> The <a title="Eater Of Worlds" class="mw-redirect">Eater Of Worlds</a> gives you around 2 stacks of 99 <span class="link"><a href="DemoniteBar.html" title="Demonite Bar">Demonite Bars</a></span> Each world spawns ABOUT 6-10 <a title="Shadow Orbs" class="mw-redirect">Shadow Orbs</a> Therefor spawning ABOUT 3 <a title="Eater Of Worlds" class="mw-redirect">Eater Of Worlds</a> Which spawns ABOUT 1 or 2 Platinum <strong class="selflink">Coins</strong> and a few <a title="Gold">Gold</a> <strong class="selflink">Coins</strong> You will need these:1.A <a title="Gold">Gold</a> <a title="Pickaxe" class="mw-redirect">pickaxe</a> or 1 <span class="link"><a href="Dynamite.html" title="Dynamite">Dynamite</a></span> 2.A <a title="Gold">Gold</a> or better <a title="Sword" class="mw-redirect">Sword</a>, 3.To be able to kill the <a title="Eater Of Worlds" class="mw-redirect">Eater Of Worlds</a>.</p><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Storage"> Storage </span></h2><p>Like other items, Coins can be stored in <span class="link"><a href="Chest.html" title="Chest">Chests</a></span> and <span class="link"><a href="PiggyBank.html" title="Piggy Bank">Piggy Banks</a></span>. It is recommended to always store them, as it will prevent them from being dropped upon <a title="Death">death</a> (<a title="Softcore mode">Softcore mode</a>), the penalty of which is dropping half of your <i>carried</i> coins (rounded up).</p><p>Inside the <a title="Inventory">Inventory</a>, Coins have their own special set of 4 slots on the right of the inventory grid.</p><p>If for some reason, you cannot store your coins, and are carrying a single high value coin (a Gold Coin early, or a Platinum Coin later), then it might be a smart move to "break" the coin: If you were to die, you would lose only half of the low currency Coins, as opposed to the entire high currency coin.</p><p>The maximum coins a player can hold with only using the coin slots is 400 platinum coins (4 slots times 100 platinum per stack). This is equivalent to four hundred million (400,000,000) copper total. If the player were to clean out all his inventory and replace them each with 100 platinum coins stacks, then the total would be 4,000 (in 40 inventory slots) plus 400 (in 4 coin slots), for a total of four thousand and four hundred platinum (4,400), which would be equivalent to four billion and four hundred million copper (4,400,000,000).</p><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Crafting"> Crafting </span></h2><p>Coins can be crafted <a title="By hand" class="mw-redirect">by hand</a>. Each coin is worth 100 of the sub denomination (Copper -&gt; Silver -&gt; Gold -&gt; Platinum). A point of interest to note is that when the player picks up an item, the coins are <i>automatically</i> crafted if possible. This means that if the player picks up hundreds of Silver Coins, he'll end up with a few Gold Coins in his inventory, and less than 100 Silver Coins.This means that you can craft coins a lot easier (especially if you are up against a wall) by simply throwing a stack of coins out of your inventory. When you pick them up, they will be crafted for you. So if you threw 100 silver coins out of your inventory, you would pick up 1 gold instead.</p><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Notes"> Notes </span></h2><ul><li>Uncollected coins sparkle when in the vicinity of a light source, and will actually amplify its light.
