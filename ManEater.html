It is a plant which consists of an extendable stem topped by an oval-shaped 'head' with claws. The stem itself is a passive component and can be walked past safely without incurring damage; only the plant's head is dangerous to the player and the only part of the plant which can be attacked. It always extends its stem to the maximum length in the direction of the player, but can retract and shorten if the player goes within its length. It is similar in appearance and behavior to that of the <span class="link"><a href="Snatcher.html" title="Snatcher">Snatcher</a></span>.</p><p>Due to their ability to pass through blocks this plant can easily surprise and kill players who are caught unawares. Destroying the <span class="link"><a href="StoneBlock.html" title="Stone Block">Stone Block</a></span> or <span class="link"><a href="MudBlock.html" title="Mud Block">Mud Block</a></span> that one is rooted on kills it instantly; however, this method of dispatching a Man Eater never yields any dropped items.</p><p>Man Eaters deal a <i>lot</i> of damage - they have the strongest "melee" attack of any pre-<a title="Hardmode">hardmode</a> enemy - close contact with them should be avoided. They are particularly dangerous because they can catch players who do not bring sufficient illumination unawares. Caution is advised even when the player seems to be out of the Man Eater's reach, as they will periodically extend their stems to a second maximum length for several moments before retracting back to their original length.</p><p>Man Eaters are immune to knockback and the <a title="Poisoned">Poisoned</a> debuff.</p><h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Tips"> Tips </span></h4><p>-When lit on fire with weapons such as the <span class="link"><a href="Sunfury.html" title="Sunfury">Sunfury</a></span>, their erratic movement patterns may cause them to reveal hidden caves with their light. </p><h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Differences_from_Snatchers"> Differences from Snatchers </span></h4><ul><li>Man Eaters can be distinguished from Snatchers by their body color, which is a brown/pinkish vine, as opposed to a green vine for <span class="link"><a href="Snatcher.html" title="Snatcher">Snatchers</a></span>. </li><li>Man Eaters have a chance to drop <span class="link"><a href="Vine.html" title="Vine">Vines</a></span>, whereas Snatchers don't. </li><li>Man Eaters spawn in the Underground Jungle biome, as opposed to the <span class="link"><a href="Jungle.html" title="Jungle">Jungle</a></span> biome.
