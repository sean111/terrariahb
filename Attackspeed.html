<p><strong class="selflink">Attack speed</strong> in Terraria is handled in a somewhat unusual fashion compared to the accepted "norms" of other games featuring this combat model. While attack speed items do stack together, the actual bonus derived is different than a player would expect based on the in-game description. </p><p>The descriptions presented on items themselves are inaccurate. A description could say "10% melee attack speed" when the actual bonus is closer to 11.1%. This is because the bonus actually reduces the time to attack to 0.9 of base and ((1 / 0.9) - 1) * 100 = 11.11%.</p><p>Bonuses are multiplicative so to find your total bonus you must multiply the reductions together. For instance if you have <span class="link"><a href="#FeralClaws" title="Feral Claws">Feral Claws</a></span> equipped and are <a title="Tipsy">Tipsy</a> the total bonus would be  0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 or a 23.46% increase.</p><p>Furthermore, the attack speed bonus through gear is <b>capped</b> at 42.86% or 0.7 of base. You can reach this a cap using a combination of:</p><ul><li><a title="Shadow armor">Shadow armor</a> x3, <span class="link"><a href="#FeralClaws" title="Feral Claws">Feral Claws</a></span> and <a title="Well Fed">Well Fed</a> ~ (0.93 * 0.93 * 0.93 * 0.88 * 0.95 = 0.6724)<ul><li>Substituting <a title="Tipsy">Tipsy</a> for Feral Claws gives 0.6877)</li></ul></li></ul><h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Melee_Attack_Speed"> Melee Attack Speed </span></h3><p>Melee attack speed affects the swing speed of almost all melee items. This includes swords, pickaxes, hammers and other tools. However, improving your melee attack speed <b>won't</b> improve the speed of mining.</p><!-- NewPP limit reportPreprocessor node count: 3/1000000Post-expand include size: 0/2097152 bytesTemplate argument size: 0/2097152 bytesExpensive parser function count: 0/100--><!-- Saved in parser cache with key wiki_terrariaonline:pcache:idhash:1511-1!*!0!!en!* and timestamp 20111212161336 --></div>
