He can be found at the <span class="link"><a href="Dungeon.html" title="Dungeon">Dungeon</a></span>'s entrance. When spoken to at night, the Old Man will give the player the option to "curse", which summons Skeletron. The Dungeon cannot be fully explored until Skeletron is defeated.</p><p>When spoken to during the <a title="Day" class="mw-redirect">day</a>, the Old Man will tell you to return at <a title="Night" class="mw-redirect">night</a>. He will also judge players with less than 300 life (15 hearts) or less than 10 defense as unworthy, but still allows them to summon Skeletron.</p><p>The Dungeon can be entered without killing Skeletron, but traveling deeper than ground level within it (below zero depth) will spawn <span class="link"><a href="DungeonGuardian.html" title="Dungeon Guardian">Dungeon Guardians</a></span> that will instantly kill the player. </p><p>When Skeletron is killed, the Old Man is freed from his curse and will arrive as the <span class="link"><a href="Clothier.html" title="Clothier">Clothier</a></span> (as long as a vacant <a title="House" class="mw-redirect">House</a> is available), in addition to allowing access to the Dungeon.</p><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Notes"> Notes </span></h2><ul><li> The Old Man can be hurt with <a title="Lava">Lava</a> (though he only takes one damage per second), <span class="link"><a href="DartTrap.html" title="Dart Trap">Dart Traps</a></span>, which cause normal damage and poison effects and <a title="Explosives (class)">Explosives</a>, and will take damage from a rolling <span class="link"><a href="Boulder.html" title="Boulder">Boulder</a></span> like all other NPCs. However monsters do not deal damage to him. Killing the old man is pointless though, since his death does not eliminate the Dungeon Guardians that will appear inside the Dungeon, nor does he drop any items.</li><li> If the Old Man dies, or the player fails to defeat Skeletron, the Old Man will respawn at the Dungeon entrance the following day.</li><li> Most Dungeon entrances spawn just barely above zero depth, which means most Dungeons are not accessible before Skeletron's defeat (without being killed by Dungeon Guardians, as they spawn below 0 depth in the area of the dungeon).</li><li> The Old Man can fall through layer 0 of the dungeon, preventing Skeletron from being summoned until the Old Man returns. This is only possible when the player is not near the Dungeon.</li></ul><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Quotes"> Quotes </span></h2><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:66px;"><a class="image"></a>  <div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"></div>The <b>Old Man</b> in front of the dungeon.</div></div></div><p><b>Only during day:</b></p><ul><li> "Come back at night if you wish to enter."</li><li> "I cannot let you enter until you free me of my curse."</li><li> "My master cannot be summoned under the light of day."</li></ul><p><b>Only when you have 300 or less max health or 10 or less defense:</b></p><ul><li> "You are far too weak to defeat my curse.
