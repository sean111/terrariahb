Each is worth 100 of the coin of the previous value. One Platinum Coin is worth one million Copper Coins and so on.</p><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Obtaining_Coins"> Obtaining Coins </span></h2><p>Coins can be acquired by killing <a title="Monster" class="mw-redirect">monsters</a>, breaking <span class="link"><a href="Pot.html" title="Pot">pots</a></span>, finding in <span class="link"><a href="Chest.html" title="Chest">chests</a></span> or trading with <a title="NPC">NPCs</a> or other players. Despite Coins being made of materials such as "Copper", "Silver", "Gold" or "Platinum" , it is impossible to craft them from Ore, Bars, or any other item in general (apart from a different rank of Coins)</p><h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Death_Penalty">Death Penalty</span></h3><p>Upon player death (in <a title="Softcore" class="mw-redirect">Softcore</a> Mode), half of all the stacks the player posses in their inventory will be dropped (rounded up if the number is odd). For example, if the player possesses 1 Gold coin in one stack, it will be dropped, but if it is instead 10 coins; 5 will be dropped.</p><ul><li> Note that committing suicide via the use of the players <a title="Weapon" class="mw-redirect">Weapon</a>, such as explosives, will <b>not</b> cause the player to drop any coins, even if recently damaged by an enemy. <ul><li> Other forms of suicide such as from <a title="Fall Damage" class="mw-redirect">Fall Damage</a>, or <a title="Chaos State">Chaos State</a>, will still cause coins to drop.</li></ul></li></ul><h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Coin_harvest_techniques"> Coin harvest techniques </span></h3><dl><dd><i>See <a title="Guide:Making Money" class="mw-redirect">Guide:Making Money</a> for more information on acquiring coins.</i></dd></dl><p>An easy way to acquire Coins is to harvest <span class="link"><a href="SandBlock.html" title="Sand Block">Sand Blocks</a></span>, craft the sand into <span class="link"><a href="Glass.html" title="Glass">Glass</a></span> then <span class="link"><a href="Bottle.html" title="Bottle">Bottles</a></span>, and then sell those to an <a title="NPC">NPC</a> for 4 copper per tile of sand. Crafting <span class="link"><a href="Ale.html" title="Ale">Ale</a></span> via <span class="link"><a href="Mug.html" title="Mug">Mugs</a></span> and a <span class="link"><a href="Keg.html" title="Keg">Keg</a></span> is even more profitable, as it turns 2 sand into 20 copper for an exchange of 10 copper per unit of sand (or 99 silver and 90 copper per full stack).</p><p>You can also farm the <span class="link"><a href="EyeofCthulhu.html" title="Eye of Cthulhu">Eye of Cthulhu</a></span> for <span class="link"><a href="DemoniteOre.html" title="Demonite Ore">Demonite Ore</a></span> if you have good enough weapons and armor. ( The Eye of Cthulhu is spawned using the suspicious looking eye)  A single Eye will yield an average of about 50 Demonite Ore each time, selling for 8 silver each (about 4 gold in total).  You can also farm the <span class="link"><a href="EaterofWorlds.html" title="Eater of Worlds">Eater of Worlds</a></span>, which will net about 10 gold if everything is collected (although it is arguably more difficult to obtain the materials needed to summon it).</p><p>Another quite easy way is to make another world, go to the <a title="Corruption" class="mw-redirect">Corruption</a>, locate a <span class="link"><a href="ShadowOrb.html" title="Shadow Orb">Shadow Orb</a></span> and then use a <a title="Hammer" class="mw-redirect">hammer</a> to break the Shadow Orbs, selling the items you get from them (which is optional). Once you have broken 3 Shadow Orbs the <a title="Eater Of Worlds" class="mw-redirect">Eater Of Worlds</a> will spawn. Kill him and collect everything. Turn the <span class="link"><a href="DemoniteOre.html" title="Demonite Ore">Demonite Ore</a></span> into bars, then sell them. One stack of 99 <span class="link"><a href="DemoniteBar.html" title="Demonite Bar">Demonite Bars</a></span> can sell for 31 <span class="link"><a href="GoldCoin.html" title="Gold Coin" class="mw-redirect">Gold Coins</a></span>. Each world spawns with about 6-10 Shadow Orbs, therefore spawning about 3 Eater Of Worlds, which, in total, would drop about one or two <span class="link"><a href="PlatinumCoin.html" title="Platinum Coin" class="mw-redirect">Platinum Coins</a></span> and a few Gold Coins.</p><p>If you have advanced through the game to the point of acquiring a <span class="link"><a href="Bucket.html" title="Bucket">Bucket</a></span> and <span class="link"><a href="NightmarePickaxe.html" title="Nightmare Pickaxe">Nightmare Pickaxe</a></span>, you can create an <span class="link"><a href="Obsidian.html" title="Obsidian">Obsidian</a></span> Generator to mass-produce <span class="link"><a href="ObsidianSkull.html" title="Obsidian Skull">Obsidian Skulls</a></span>.  These sell for 54 silver each, so selling just two of them gives you over 1 Gold Coin.  With this technique, it is possible to acquire the <span class="link"><a href="Minishark.html" title="Minishark">Minishark</a></span>, with a price of 35 gold, in half an hour.</p><p>In <a title="Hardmode">hardmode</a>, traveling to the <a title="Underground Hallow">Underground Hallow</a> and collecting as many <span class="link"><a href="CrystalShard.html" title="Crystal Shard">Crystal Shards</a></span> as possible is an extremely efficient way to acquire large amounts of money, as one full stack (consisting of 250 shards) sells for 40 gold coins (16 silver coins per shard), plus it doesn't require any specific early investment or preparation (other than reaching <a title="Hardmode">hardmode</a> itself). Crystals are abundant, easy to locate and mine, and respawn. Killing enemies that appear as you run around the Underground Hallow will let you collect even more coins.</p><p>If you have already progressed far into Hardmode, farming <span class="link"><a href="TheDestroyer.html" title="The Destroyer">The Destroyer</a></span> for his <span class="link"><a href="HallowedBar.html" title="Hallowed Bar">Hallowed Bars</a></span> (as of <a title="1.2" class="mw-redirect">1.2</a>) can make a really high profit. Just craft the Hallowed Bars into a <span class="link"><a href="Gungnir.html" title="Gungnir">Gungnir</a></span> over and over again and sell those. A Gungnir without any prefixes sells for 30 Gold, and considering the ease with which one can beat The Destroyer, it's only a matter of acquiring enough <span class="link"><a href="MechanicalWorm.html" title="Mechanical Worm">Mechanical Worms</a></span>.</p><p>If you have a fish statue and some wire, hook up the statue and grind the goldfish. You can get gold fish, and rarely, fish banners. Selling the goldfish at 1 silver per fish is quite good. </p><p>If you have a jellyfish statue, wire the statue and grind the jellyfish. You can get glowsticks, Jellyfish necklaces, and rarely, jellyfish banners. The jellyfish necklace sells for 1 gold coin.</p><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Storage"> Storage </span></h2><p>Like other items, Coins can be stored in <span class="link"><a href="Chest.html" title="Chest">Chests</a></span> and <span class="link"><a href="PiggyBank.html" title="Piggy Bank">Piggy Banks</a></span>. It is recommended to always store them, as it will prevent them from being dropped upon <a title="Death">death</a> (<a title="Softcore mode">Softcore mode</a>), the penalty of which is dropping half of your <i>carried</i> coins (rounded up).</p><p>Inside the <a title="Inventory">Inventory</a>, Coins have their own special set of 4 slots on the right of the inventory grid.</p><p>If for some reason, you cannot store your coins, and are carrying a single high value coin (a Gold Coin early, or a Platinum Coin later), then it might be a smart move to "break" the coin: If you were to die, you would lose only half of the low currency Coins, as opposed to the entire high currency coin.</p><p>You can also get Gold Coins from lost loot in caves. They look like bags with coins flowing out of them.</p><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Crafting"> Crafting </span></h2><p>On the PC version, Coins can be crafted <a title="By hand" class="mw-redirect">by hand</a>. Each coin is worth 100 of the sub denomination (Copper -&gt; Silver -&gt; Gold -&gt; Platinum). A point of interest to note is that when the player picks up any variation of coin, the coins are <i>automatically</i> crafted if possible. This means that if the player picks up hundreds of Silver Coins, they'll end up with a few Gold Coins in their inventory, and less than 100 Silver Coins.This means that coins may be crafted a lot easier (especially if up against a wall) by simply throwing a stack of coins out of your inventory. When picked up, they will be automatically crafted. So if the player throws 100 silver coins out of their inventory, you would pick up 1 gold instead.</p><h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Notes"> Notes </span></h2><ul><li> Uncollected coins sparkle when in the vicinity of a light source, and will actually amplify its light.
